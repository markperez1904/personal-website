# Mark's Personal Website
This is my personal website built with Nuxt.js, with each page statically generated

I implemented a headless CMS called Prismic.io to manage the blog content on my webpages.

I used GraphQL with Apollo Client to query each post and parsed what I wanted.

### Setup
- Clone the repo
- `cd` into the directory
- run `npm install`
- run `npm run generate` to generate the files.
- run `npm run start` to preview the changes.

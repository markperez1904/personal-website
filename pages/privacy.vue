    <h3>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h3>
    <p>
      CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial
      websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law&rsquo;s
      reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in
      the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites
      collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers
      to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the
      information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom
      it is being shared. &ndash; See more at:
      http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf
    </p>
    <h3>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Users can visit our site anonymously.</li>
      <li>
        Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our
        home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering
        our website.
      </li>
      <li>
        Our Privacy Policy link includes the word &lsquo;Privacy&rsquo; and can
        easily be found on the page specified above.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>On our Privacy Policy Page</li>
      <li>Can change your personal information:</li>
      <li>By emailing us</li>
      <li>Through managing third parties</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</h3>
    <p>
      We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use
      advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.
    </p>
    <h3>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</h3>
    <p>
      It&rsquo;s also important to note that we allow third-party behavioral
      tracking
    </p>
    <h3>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h3>
    <p>
      When it comes to the collection of personal information from children
      under the age of 13 years old, the Children&rsquo;s Online Privacy
      Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade
      Commission, United States&rsquo; consumer protection agency, enforces the
      COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online
      services must do to protect children&rsquo;s privacy and safety online.
    </p>
    <h3>
      We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Do we let third-parties, including ad networks or plug-ins collect PII
      from children under 13
    </p>
    <h3>Fair Information Practices</h3>
    <p>
      The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law
      in the United States and the concepts they include have played a
      significant role in the development of data protection laws around the
      globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they
      should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws
      that protect personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the
      following responsive action, should a data breach occur:
    </p>
    <h3>We will notify you via email within 30 business days</h3>
    <p>
      We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that
      individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against
      data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This
      principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights
      against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or
      government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data
      processors.
